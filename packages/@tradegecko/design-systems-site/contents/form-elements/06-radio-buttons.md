# Radio buttons

Radio buttons are used to show multiple choices (more than two), but users can ***only*** **select one**.


## Appearance and behavior

Here are some examples of what radio buttons can look like.

- The default view displays all available options.
- We can add a label or instruction to guide the user to select.
- We can disable some choices if they’re not available to that customer.
- We can display the choices with a default option selected to encourage the customer to act.
- The inline version displays options horizontally.
- An asterisk at the end of the label can let users know they need to make a selection.
- We need to keep word count to a minimum for the option value.

*Note: Currently we only use Radio buttons on “Schedule a call” modal and “Cancel Account”. We need to evaluate whether to continue or phase out radio buttons moving onwards.*
