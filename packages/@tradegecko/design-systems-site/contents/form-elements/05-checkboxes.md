# Checkboxes

Checkboxes are used to show multiple choices (more than two), and the users can **select more than one**. 

Besides, checkboxes are also used to toggle a **single option or preference**. An example of this is “This product has multiple variants” in the *Create a New Product* page, which allows users to check for multiple variants, then only the *Variant Option* and *Options Values* are presented, to avoid overwhelming of users with information.
