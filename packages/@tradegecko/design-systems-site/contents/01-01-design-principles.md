## Our Design Principles
1. **Design needs to add value, for all customers**

*Design decisions should delight all customers by always being functional, useable and reliable.*


2. **Design makes the complex, simple**

*We do the heavy lifting for the user, providing trustful advice that allows them to operate fast and focus on growing their business.*


3. **Data driven from empathy**

*We are driven by empathy for the user, and use data to validate that we are solving their most relevant issues first.*


4. **Done, tested, validated. Perfection is incremental**

*Getting small steps done and validated with users is the way to a more useful, reliable and delightful app. Testing is the fastest way to a delightful customer experience.*


5. **Design is a collaborative work**

*Getting input and quick feedback while designing gives more value to our work and allows us to iterate faster.*
