# Copy Guidelines

## Our voice is who we are. The tone is how we speak.

### Tone of voice

Below are the tone of voice definitions we use to ensure we always write from our values, everywhere on the app. They contain the guidelines we hold as central tenets, how we’ve applied them and their result.

While writing for different audiences and areas of the business may need different particulars to allow our copy to do its best work, our company level tone of voice always come first and govern how we communicate.


- What’s the best narrative at any point in the app?
- **Tone is suppose to take you on a journey, holding your hand and helping you be successful**
## Words at TradeGecko

Our words need to reflect how we connect to each and every entrepreneur. They do much more than encourage a click or scroll - they set the tone for the entire experience our customers have with TradeGecko and leave a long-lasting impression. Copy needs to be adequate to the immediate user need.

Writing responsibly with a unified tone of voice means we’re putting the customer first, knowing how to engage them, communicate our values and earn their trust.

## Write for all founders

Our customer’s primary focus should be grow their business, and we’re here to make that easier and more enjoyable. Therefore our language must be simple, objective and efficient to help them achieve their best results.

**Tips**

- Keep it short
- Use headings to make your content scannable (grasp in 8 seconds)
- Avoid jargon and always use a short, simple words.
- Making sense to the customer is more important than being technically accurate
- Say what customers say (use their language). Research what terms they’re already familiar with
- Less is always more. Make sure the copy adds value
- make microcopy meaningful with a CTA. Example: “*Questions?* *We’re here to help**!*” instead of “*Need a helping hand getting set up?* *We'd love to help**!*”
- Read your content out loud. Edit. Simplify


----------
## Encourage action

People use TradeGecko to get things done. Our content should be written to help our customers to know which actions are the most important ones.

**Tips**

- CTAs and buttons should start with a verb that sets user’s expectation of what’s going to happen.
- Prioritize the most important information and task.
- Make it hard to make a irreversible mistake
- Break down tasks into easy to follow steps

Use active voice [*Subject* (person/thing acting) *verb* (the action) *object* (receives the action)] to clarify the subject and the action.

[How do we speak to customer? You? My? I? We? Our?] @Neeta N 

----------
## Consistency in speech

To help our customers to understand our product, use consistent nouns (people, places, things) and verbs (action words) wherever possible.

**Tips**

- Make a list of the most important verbs and nouns in the experience you are building.
- If such list doesn’t exist, sync with marketing and create the list
- Edit the word list. Can something be clearer and simpler?
- Does your language reflect our customer’s words?
- Eliminate synonyms. Each object and action should be represented by a single word.
