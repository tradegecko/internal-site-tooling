# Colors

Colors communicate function and state. It helps us to create visual patterns that make our product predictable for our users.

## Color Guidelines

**Communication**
We value the aesthetic use of color, but we value clear communication more. Our use of color must be purposeful, and serve the intention of the content.

**Accessibility**
When choosing colors, remember color blind users and those with low vision. Color shouldn’t be the only means of conveying information. Contrast on the interface should follow at least [c](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) [AA](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) guidelines.

**Focus**
Color should bring focus to what matter most, and support the hierarchy of the experience.

Colors should always be used as scss variables. Here are our primary colors:

**Brand colors**

## Accessibility

It’s important to meet all web accessibility standards. Meet the minimum contrast rations specified by WCAG 2.1 Level AA for text, icons, illustrations, background colors.
