# Spacing

Consistent spacing creates unified layouts that create consistent interfaces and a seamless user experience. This consistency contributes to a harmonious, coordinated appearance that makes the user interface (UI) easier for users to scan across all our products. 


## The Spacing System

All spacing for components and typography is done in increments of **4 pixels**. 

This 4px value forms the basic unit of measurement for spacing. We want to create a scale that accommodates with the least amount of variables the greatest flexibility throughout the majority of our use cases.
