# CTA button at the fixed bottom footer

CTA button at the fixed bottom footer is used if a form is too long. The CTA button is displayed at a fixed position at the footer bar to avoid users have to scroll down the long forms just to *Create a Product* or *Submit the Form*. It can be a long form with hundreds of line-items at one page. 

The reason why the CTA button is aligned on the left side because pagination can then be displayed on the right side of the footer bar. There might be a secondary button such as "Save as draft" that is placed on the right side of the primary CTA. Cancel is a text.
