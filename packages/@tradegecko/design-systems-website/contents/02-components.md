# Components

Components are the building blocks which when combined form complete and meaningful user interfaces. They can be combined and reused to create user experiences.

Components should be carefully added. The process to create a component is described below. Due to the care on creating components, they should encompass the majority of use cases.

Using components allows designers and developers to focus on solving users pain points.

## Getting started

Each component includes information to help you implement them, such as:
