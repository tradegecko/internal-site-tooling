# Icons

Icons act as visual aids to help users to complete tasks. At TradeGecko we use Font Awesome to help the user to understand actions at a glance. 

## Principles

**Simplicity**
Icons should be simple and obvious, mitigating cognitive load instead of increasing it.

**Solid**
As much as possible we use solid versions of the icons, that provide more contrast and legibility than outline ones.

**Paired with text**
Icons should be legible at all sizes and should always be paired with text. Icons are meant to clarify meaning and allow user to scan the UI. Rare exceptions are the trash icon or the **x** to close modals.

**Professional over fun**
Icons communicate with the content theyâ€™re paired with. Focus on setting expectation of what will happen after instead of how nice it looks.

**Think about the user**
Our users can be in different countries, with different currencies, different languages... keep that in mind when designing icons that communicate with ALL customers. No founder is left behind.
