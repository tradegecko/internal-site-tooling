# Illustrations
## Principles

**Usefulness**
Illustration should provide context, add clarity, leads to next steps.

**Consistency**
All illustrations should look and feel as the same voice. Consistency means quality and attention to detail.

**Focus**
One single message per illustration. Also, one single focal point. With every illustration we can ask ourselves: “What is the single more important thing to get out of this for the user?”

## Good places for the use of illustration

When users can get frustrated, stuck or don’t know where to go next, an illustration can bridge the gap and point them in the right direction. If a feature is miss or underused, illustrations can also provide value. Congratulate and provide feedback of actions is another good use of illustration. Few more examples:

- Empty states
- On-boarding
- Announcements
- Progress indicators
## Background context

Our illustration style is gray background `#f4f6fa` with the following characteristics:

- Plenty of white space
- One focused element in color
- Background elements in TG grays
- No stock photos

## Form factor

Consider if the illustration is going to be used on emails, mobile app/web or desktop.

## Default / empty states

We provide illustrations for empty avatars, documents, icons across the app. A repo of these illustrations can be found in our Sketch Library, under symbols/illustrations.
