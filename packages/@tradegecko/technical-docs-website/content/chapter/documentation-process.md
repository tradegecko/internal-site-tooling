## When Creating
Include the following in your title:
- If the RFC affects backend `[BACKEND]`
- If it affects frontend include `[FRONTEND]`
- If it affects both include `[BACKEND][FRONTEND]`

Once the pr has been created, ManagerBot will request a review from, All members based on the tag that you included in your title.

## Merging a Documentation
