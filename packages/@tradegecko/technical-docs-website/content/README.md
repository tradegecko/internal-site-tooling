# Welcome to Technical Documentation

This repo exists solely for the purpose of **tracking reviews for documentation wiki changes**. 

### How to use this Repo

If you are going to add a new page to the wiki to document a part of the app, create a PR with a the `.md` file in it - and add a comment linking to the rendered file. After that you request reviews and wait.

### Feedback
Contact someone from the frontend chapter, preferabbly through the #frontend channel on Slack
